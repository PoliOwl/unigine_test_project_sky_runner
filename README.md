# Sky Runner
This is a demo for a game created using Unigen. I've made it as a test project for learning Unigen.
## Game discription
This is a first-person platformer, where you need to jump from platform to platform to collect bonuses, that give you points. But you need to move fast since any platform that is near you will fall down unless you jump on it.
This game is endless and platforms will spawn until you fall.
